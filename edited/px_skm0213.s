 * **NOTE**: I have not returned back to the main function using PUSH {LR} and POP {PC}, which is the conventional way,
 *      because when I try to do that, the program prints 0.0 as the output in alternate runs.
        For example,
        With PUSH {LR} and POP {PC}:
        9
        i
        0.111111
        9
        i
        0.000000
        9
        i
        0.111111
        
        But, without PUSH {LR} and POP {PC},
         9
         i
         0.111111
         9
         i
         0.111111
         9
         i
         0.111111
         9
         i
         0.111111
        
        I have tried debugging it and added extra Pushes and Pops for R1 and R2, but it gives me the same result.
        I have made sure that this program will not cause a stack overflow because of incorrect pushing and popping.
